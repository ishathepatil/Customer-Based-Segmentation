# Customer-Based-Segmentation
This repo consists of the EDA done on a customer dataset to understand the trends and insight by segregating it into different groups and further performing a thorough cluster analysis.

This will help us to serve different marketing stratergies for different group of customers.

2. Annual Income of the customers
